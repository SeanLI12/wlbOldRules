    <p class="b sub" id="pagetop">CASH OUT RULES</p>
    <p class="b sub" style="font-size:13px"><em>Last Update: 02/09/2019</em></p>
    <p><strong>General Rules</strong></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li>Cash Out is only  available on selected sports and market types. <br>
      </li>
      <li>The availability  of Cash Out may be withdrawn or adjusted at any time. Customers should never  assume Cash Out will be available.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Cash Out values  are non-negotiable. The company will not enter into discussion about the reason  for any Cash Out value offered.<br>
      </li>
      <li><p>For  partial Cash Out, the minimum unit stake (per market type) must remain on  either side of the partial cash out range.</p>
		  
        <p> Example 1 – Minimum Unit Stake = <strong>1.00</strong> / Customer Stake = <strong>100.00</strong>. Bets can be partially cashed  out in the range of <strong>1.00 - 99.00</strong>.<br>
          Example 2 - Minimum Unit Stake = <strong>1.00</strong> / Customer Stake = <strong>5.00</strong>. Bets can be  partially cashed out in the range of <strong>1.00  - 4.00</strong>.<br>
          Example 3 – Minimum Unit Stake = <strong>1.00</strong> / Customer Stake = <strong>1.00</strong>.  Bets cannot be partially cashed out. However, they can still be fully cashed out.<br>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>The  Cash Out value displayed for any bet is the amount returned to your account should  the Cash Out be successful. This includes the stake value related to the cashed-out  amount.</p>
		
      <p>Example 1 – If Cash Out is showing <strong>1,500.00 </strong>and the related stake was <strong>1,000.00</strong>, the Win / Loss if confirmed  would be <strong>+ 500.00 </strong>(Win)<br>
        Example 2 – If Cash Out is showing <strong>800.00 </strong>and the related stake was <strong>1,000.00</strong>, the Win / Loss if confirmed  would be <strong>- 200.00 </strong>(Loss)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Settlement Rules</strong></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li>Should  an event be cancelled or postponed, the company reserves the right to cancel  and reverse any previously cashed out bet, unless the market has been  unconditionally determined. </li>
      <li>Should  an event be suspended and fail to resume within 36hours, the company reserves  the right to cancel and reverse any previously cashed out bet, unless the  market has been unconditionally determined.</li>
      <li>Should  a cashed out wager be subject to cancellation, the company reserves the right to  cancel that wager and reverse the cash out.</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <p><strong>Settlement Examples</strong></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li><strong>Single Bets – Fully Cashed Out</strong><br>
        <br>
        Should a single bet be fully cashed out for an event or wager which is later cancelled,  the cashed out amount will be returned to the company and the original stake  amount returned to the customer.<br>
        <br>
        However, should the cashed out bet have been for a specific period (e.g.  Football 1st Half or Basketball 1st Quarter) and the  event was cancelled after these periods had been completed, the Cash Out will  be valid.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Single Bet – Partially Cashed Out<br>
        </strong><br>
        Should a single bet be partially cashed out for an event or wager which is  later cancelled, the cashed out amount will be returned to the company and the  partially cashed out stake amount returned to the customer.<br>
        <br>
        The remaining stake (not included in the initial partial Cash Out) will also be  void and returned to the customer’s account. <br>
        <br>
        However, should the cashed out bet have been for a specific period (e.g.  Football 1st Half or Basketball 1st Quarter) and the  event was cancelled after these periods had been completed, the Cash Out and  remaining stake will be valid.<strong></strong></li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Multiples  Bets – when a selection event is cancelled.<br>
        <br>
        </strong>Should one or more selection from a multiple bet  be cancelled, any previous cash out will be void, unless the market had been  unconditionally determined.<br>
        <br>
        For straight accumulators (X1), any remaining selections will be settled at the  original stake. For example, a 5-fold (of selections A, B, C, D and E) where B  is voided, will be settled as a 4-fold for the combined odds of A, C, D and E.<br>
        <br>
        Should any of the remaining selections be available for betting, then the  possibility to Cash Out may once again appear. However, should all the  remaining selections be settled, then the bet will be settled accordingly. </li>
