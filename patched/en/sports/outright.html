        	<ul style="list-style:decimal">
                <li>All Outright bets are settled on the results stated by the official governing body of each league or competition.</li>
                <li>All outright bets are considered valid regardless of whether the selection participates or not.</li>
                <li>Dead Heat rules apply to outright betting markets.</li>
                <li>Wherever the term "Any Other Player" or "Any Other Team", etc. is used, this will refer to all competitors who are unnamed in the market.</li>
                <li>Sports that have rules for individual outright markets shall supersede these general outright rules where applicable.</li>
              <li>For Outright bets relating to the end of any specific month: The market will be suspended at 23:59 UKT on the last day of the previous month.
