                    	<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
						<li>Bets are subjected to rules which are applicable for each sport, (e.g. Soccer, Tennis, Bowling, Biathlon, Curling etc) found in our general sports rules.  </li>
            <li>General betting rules are applicable to any situations not covered by these rules.  </li>
            <li>For betting purposes, participants awarded Gold, Silver and Bronze at the medal ceremony will be deemed as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winner.  </li>
            <li>Podium positions will count as the official results, regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result.  </li>
         
            <li>All Outright bets will be considered valid if the event is completed within the official period of the Olympic Games, irrespective of the actual start time. Bets will also be considered valid if an official result is declared by the Official International Olympic Committee (IOC). Should a match be uncompleted, and no official result is given, then all bets will be considered void and all wagers placed will be refunded.  </li>
            <li>If the event starts before the scheduled time, only bets placed before the event commenced will be considered valid. Bets placed after the event commenced will be considered void. This excludes In-Play bet types.  </li>
            <li>Bets are settled according to the official results of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or any official body deemed to have such authority for competitions even in the absence of a medal ceremony.  </li>
