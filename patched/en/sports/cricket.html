                    	<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
						           <li>If the scheduled venue is changed, all bets will stand so long as the venue is not changed to an opponent’s ground. International venues may be changed, so long as the new venue is within the same country.</li>
<li>All batsman markets will be settled on runs scored by the named batsman. Extra’s recorded while a batsmen is on strike will not be attributed their total number of runs in that Innings.</li>

   	</ul>
   
        <div class="sbk-rules-title">Test Matches &amp; County Championship Matches</div>
          <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
			<li>Bets will stand based on the official result provided  at least one ball has been bowled. In the event of a tie, all bets on Winner  will be void and bets on the draw in 1 x 2 will be settled as losing bets.<br><br>
				<u>Tie vs. Draw </u>
			  <br>
			  <br>
				The result of a match is ‘Tie’ when the scores are equal at the conclusion of play after both teams completed their innings, or, in Limited Overs Cricket, the set number of overs has been played, or play is terminally stopped by weather or bad light.
			  <br>
			  <br>
				‘Draw’ is the inconclusive result that occurs when a team does not complete its innings at the scheduled end of play. It only applies to First Class Cricket.
			  <br><br>
			</li>

           <li>If a match is delayed due to rain (or any other reason) all bets will be settled based on the official result.</li>
<li>In Test matches, “Batsman Runs”, “Innings Runs” &amp; “Player Match Bets” stand regardless of the length of the innings.</li>

            <li>If a match is abandoned due to external interference, bets will be considered void.  </li>
  
		</ul>
   
        <div class="sbk-rules-title">Limited Overs Matches</div>
            <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
			<li>In one-day matches, if the match is cut short or abandoned due to weather or external interference, all bets will be settled according to the official competition rules. This includes matches affected by the Duckworth-Lewis Method (D/L Method) or the Jayadevan system (JVD). If the final result is determined by a bowl out or coin toss, all bets will be considered void.</li>
            <li>If the match ends in a tie and the official result or the competition rules do not determine a winner, then all bets on Winner will be void. In competitions where a bowl out or a super over determines a winner, all bets will be considered void.</li>
            <li>Where the Duckworth Lewis Method (D/L method) is used, all bets placed on "Highest 10 over Total", "Highest Opening Partnership", “Batsmen Match Bet” and “Bowler Match Bet” will be considered void, unless the market has been unconditionally determined before the D/L method was implemented. Batsmen/Bowler Match Bets offered after D/L method will be settled based on the new overs. </li>
            <li>Should a new toss take place on a scheduled  reserve day for One Day International, all bets during the last 45 minutes to  the start at the original scheduled first day match will be considered void.  This rule applies to all markets, except those have been unconditionally  determined, such as "Win The Toss"
