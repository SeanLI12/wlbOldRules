   	<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
                <li>Both participants must leave the start line / gate for bets to stand. If an event comprises of just one round, then official results from that round will be used for settlement purposes. </li>
                <li>The player that qualifies with a higher position or scores more points is deemed the winner. In the event that there is no way to discern which player places in a higher position or scores more points, all bets will be considered void. </li>
                <li>For multiple round events, if both participants fail to qualify for the next round, all bets will be considered void. If both participants qualify for the next round but none make to the completion of the event, the participant with the fastest recorded time or scores more points in the previous round is deemed the winner. </li>

            	<ul style="list-style:decimal;margin:20px;">
            		<li>Bets will be settled according to the final score including extra "ends". The match must be completed or conceded by the losing team for bets to stand. In the event that the match does not fully complete, all bets will be considered void. </li>

            		<li>For shooting performance (including head to head) if a biathlete starts but fails to finish a race then bets will be voided except for those bets of which the outcome has already been determined at the time the athlete fails to finish. </li>

		<p style="margin-left:15px; font-size:16px"><strong>Alpine Skiing </strong></p>
            	<ul style="list-style:decimal;margin:20px;">
            		<li>Head to Head: The winner will be the skier who is placed higher in the race. If one of the skiers does not take part in the race, all bets are void. If a skier is disqualified or does not finish the race for any reason, then the other skier is deemed the winner. A skier can only be deemed a winner if they are listed in the official race classification (e.g. in the case of Slalom or Giant Slalom, both runs must be completed as specified in the event rules). If both skiers do not finish the race for any reason, the shortest time difference based on the first time check will determine the winner regardless of numbers of time check done by both skiers. </li>
