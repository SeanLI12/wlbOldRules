						<li>For betting purposes, participants awarded Gold, Silver and Bronze at the medal ceremony will be deemed as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winner. </li>
            <li>Podium positions will count as the official results, regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result.  </li>
