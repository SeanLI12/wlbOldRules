	  <p class="b sub" style="font-size:13px">&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>Each Way  consists of 2 separate bets (of equal stake amount) on a single selection; a  Win bet and a Place bet.
    </p><ol>
         <li>If  the selection wins, both stakes will be returned along with the calculated  winnings.</li>
        <li>If  the selection loses, a limited return may still be applied should the allowed  Place terms be met.</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>
		<p>Once  confirmed, an Each Way bet will display in 2 parts: Win and Place.</p>
        <p>Each available  market has its own Place terms (Finishing Position and Odds) and these define  the amount that may be won.</p>
        <p>Place terms  are usually represented as, for example, <strong>1/4  - Top 3</strong>. This means one quarter of the original odds will be returned (on  half the total stake) should the selection finish in the top three places of an  event. Place terms vary and could be <strong>1/5  - Top 5 </strong>or<strong> 1/5 - Top 7 </strong>etc.</p>
		<p>Possible outcomes  of an Each Way bet are:
	</p><ol>
				<li>Win and  Place parts both 'Win'.</li>
				<li>Win part  'Loses' &amp; Place part 'Wins'.</li>
				<li>Win and  Place parts both 'Lose'.</li>
	</ol>
     Full  examples of each may be found below General Rules.<p></p>

  <p class="sbk-rules-title"><strong>General Rules</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Each Way bets can only be placed on  specific Outright Markets. The General Rules of each Sport will apply to the  settlement of these bets.<br>
                      </li>
                      <li>Each Way terms (places and odds) will  be subject to change as an event progresses, e.g. a Golf Tournament. The terms  defined (in your statement) at the time the bet was struck will be honored, so  long as the market is each way enabled.</li>
                   
                      <li>Each Way bets may be voided, should  the number of starting participants prevent the formation of an Each Way  market. For example, 5 scheduled participants are reduced to 3 prior to the  event starting.</li>
                  
                      <li>Each Way Multiples (e.g. Doubles,  Trebles, 4-Folds etc.) can only be placed when all selections within the  betslip are Each Way enabled.</li>
                   
                      <li>Settlement of Each Way Multiples is  based on Win-to-Win and Place-to-Place (not a combination of both). For  example, if 2 selections (E/W Double) resulted in 1 Win and 1 Place, the  Win-to-Win stake will be lost, while the Place-to-Place stake will win.<br>
                      </li>
                      <li>Settlement of Each Way Win and Place  (or Place only) bets are subject to Dead Heat Rules.<br>
                        <br>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
	<p><u>Examples:</u></p>
     <ol>
    	<li><p><strong> Selection Wins (Finished 1st) </strong></p>
    		<p>Outright Markets - English Premier League (Winner)</p>
    		<p>Selection: <strong>Arsenal @ 13.0</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Stake: <strong>100.00</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;E/W  Terms - <strong>1/4 Odds, Top 3</strong></p>
    		<p><strong>Total Stake = 200.00</strong> (inc. Each Way)</p>
			<p>Result: Arsenal wins the league.</p>
			<p><strong>Win</strong> →&nbsp;13.0 (Win odds) X 100 (Win stake) = <strong>1,200.00</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Place</strong> →&nbsp;4.0 (Place odds) X 100 (Place stake) = <strong>300.00</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Win  / Loss </strong>is  1,200 + 300 <strong>= + 1,500.00</strong></p>
    	</li>
    	<li><p><strong>Selection Placed (Finished in Top 3) </strong></p>
    		<p>Outright Markets - English Premier  League (Winner)</p>
            <p>Selection: <strong>Arsenal @ 13.0</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Stake: <strong>100.00</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;E/W  Terms - <strong>1/4 Odds, Top 3</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Total Stake = 200.00</strong> (inc. Each Way)</p>
            <p>Result: Arsenal finished third.</p>
            <p><strong>Win</strong> →&nbsp;Arsenal did not win the league; therefore this is a losing bet = <strong>-100.00</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Place</strong> →&nbsp;4.0 (Place odds) X 100 (Place stake) = <strong>300.00</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Win / Loss </strong>is -100  + 300 <strong>= + 200.00</strong></p>
        </li>
    	<li><p><strong>Selection Loses (Finished outside of Top 3) </strong></p>
    	<p>Outright Markets - English Premier  League (Winner)</p>

        <p><strong>Total Stake = 200.00</strong> (inc. Each Way)</p>
        <p>Result: Arsenal finished fourth.</p>
        <p><strong>Win</strong> →&nbsp;Arsenal did not win the league; therefore this is a losing bet = <strong>-100.00</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Place</strong> →&nbsp;Arsenal did not finish in the Top 3; therefore this is a losing bet = <strong>-100.00</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Win / Loss is </strong>-100  + -100 <strong>= - 200.00</strong></p>
