						<li>If the scheduled venue is changed, all bets will be considered void.  </li>
            <li>International Baseball Rules: Games will end early if a team is leading by 10 or more runs after the opposing team has batted in at least 7 innings, or if a team is leading by 15 or more runs after the opposing team has batted in at least 5 innings. If this happens, all bets will be considered valid, including Money Line, Odd / Even, Run Line and Total Runs (Over/Under).  </li>
            <li>When betting on Winner, Handicap or Total Runs (Over / Under) the game must complete 9 innings of play (or 8.5 innings, when the 2nd batting team is already ahead) to prevent void settlement. If a game is suspended in overtime, the score will be determined after the last full inning, unless the home team scores to tie, or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning, in which case the score is determined at the time the game is finished. </li>
            <li>Extra innings count for settlement purposes, unless otherwise specified.  </li>
            <li>1st half betting is based on the result from the 1st to the end of the 5th period.  </li>
            <li>2nd half betting is based on the result from the 6th period to the end of the 9th period. Extra innings count for settlement purposes on 2nd half betting.  </li>
            <li>All Bets placed will remain valid regardless of the starting pitcher.  </li>
            <li>If the game is suspended or cancelled during the 2nd half, all 1st half bets will still be valid.  </li>
            <li>If the game is suspended or cancelled during the 2nd half, all 2nd half bets will be considered void, unless otherwise stated in the individual bet type rules.  </li>
            <li>If the game starts before the scheduled time, only bets placed before the game commenced will be considered valid. Bets placed after the game commenced will be considered void. This excludes In-Play bet types.  </li>
