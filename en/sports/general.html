  <h2 class="rule-h2">Overview</h2>
  <p>These rules are intended to define the terms and conditions that apply   to all bets accepted by us. It is your responsibility to make yourself   aware of these rules and the terms upon which your bets are accepted. We   		reserve the right to amend these rules at any time and any such   amendments will then be displayed on this website. Please note that any   additional information detailed in the "Announcements" section forms part   of the 				betting rules. In the event of any disparity, please note   that any such additional information will supersede our betting rules. </p>
  <p>We consider these rules to be fair and should you require any advice   regarding these rules please contact our customer service team. Our team   is there to help you and it is in everybody's interest to ensure that   queries and disputes are settled as quickly and amicably as possible.   The customer service team endeavours to provide prompt and considerate   attention to errors and disputes.</p>
  <p>All these rules serve only to establish the general principles that   regulate the relationship between the member and the company. In the   event of any disagreement it is not the intention of the company to   enter into a dispute with the member, but rather to find a solution,   whenever possible, for the mutual satisfaction of both parties.</p>
  
  <p class="org">GENERAL SPORTS RULES</p>
  <p>All bets placed with the company are subject to the following rules and   regulations. Any rules listed within individual sports supersede these   rules for that particular sport or market:</p>
  <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
    <li>Minimum and maximum bet amounts on all sporting events   will be determined by the company and are subject to change without   prior written notice.</li>
    <li>The company relies entirely upon the information provided   by the customer within their betting account. The company is not   responsible for any form of misrepresentation by the customer.</li>
    <li>When betting, members are solely responsible for their own   account transactions. Please be sure to review your bets for any   mistakes before submitting. Once a transaction is complete, it cannot be   changed. The company does not take responsibility for missing or   duplicate bets made by the client. Clients may review their transactions   in the "Statement Details" section of the site after each session to   ensure all requested bets were accepted.</li>
    <li>In the case of any complaints, the company does not   consider valid prints or receipts, which have not been recorded or   stored in the company files.</li>
    <li>The company reserves the right to close or suspend a customer's account at anytime.</li>
    <li>The company reserves the right to suspend betting in a market at anytime.</li>
    <li>The company reserves the right to void any bets struck on   an event where the outcome is known. Should a bet be placed at an   incorrect price due to a delay in the 'Live' coverage of an event, the   bets placed during this period of time will be voided, win or lose.</li>
    <li>Information relating to an event (e.g. dates, times,   scores, statistics, news, red cards, neutral ground details, etc.) are   for general information purposes only.  The company shall not be liable   for the accuracy in the information provided.</li>
    <li>Should a game / event be abandoned, suspended or postponed   and fail to resume after 36 hours from the official kick off / start   time, the result as it stands will be deemed void and bets will be   cancelled, unless stated otherwise in the individual sport’s rules.   Certain markets that are unconditionally determined will be settled   accordingly. The settlement procedures for these markets are stated in   the individual sport’s rules. The company's decision to cancel bets in   such an event is final and is regardless of any official decision by the   event referee or relevant governing authority. For 'Parlays', the bet   will still be considered valid, though the selection within the parlay   will be considered void. The payout formula will be calculated as (1)   for that particular selection.</li>
    <li>Should a game / event be abandoned the result as it stands   will be deemed void and bets will be cancelled, unless stated otherwise   in the individual sport’s rules. The decision and definition of   abandonment can be made at the company’s discretion.</li>
    <li>Should there be any discrepancies with team names or any   other information in other languages, the company will refer to all team   names in English.</li>
    <li>The company is not liable, under any circumstances   whatsoever, for any discrepancies, damages or loss caused by any of the   following incidents:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Disruption of service to the company's website(s), server(s) or network.</li>
        <li>Loss of data or damaged data on the company's server(s).</li>
        <li>Malicious attack on the company's website(s), server(s) or network by hackers.</li>
        <li>Slow or irregular internet service while accessing the company's website.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If there is any dispute over the interpretation of any   rules or regulation, the company's interpretation will always take   precedence.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p class="org">RESULTS AND SETTLEMENT</p>
  <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
    <li>The result of an event will be determined on the day of   its conclusion for betting purposes unless otherwise stated within the   rules for each sport or event. The company does not recognize protests   or overturned decisions for betting purposes. The company will only   reset / correct the results due to human error, system error or mistakes   made by the referring results source within 72 hours after results are   processed.</li>
    <li>Markets are usually settled at the end of the event.   However, in the interest of the member, some markets may be settled   before the official result is declared. These are markets that are   unconditionally determined and can include certain markets for events   that are abandoned, suspended or postponed. The company reserves the   right to reverse settlement in the event a market is settled in error.</li>
    <li>Results will be determined by the company using, where   possible, official sources from each sport’s governing body. Where   results are not readily available from the sport’s governing body, the   Company may use such other source(s) as it deems appropriate and   reasonable in all the circumstances.</li>
    <li>For the purpose of settling bets, the company shall take   the latest back-up data on bets placed. The company will not entertain   any complaints or disputes, unless the customer can produce a printed   copy of the betting transaction(s). Otherwise, the company’s transaction   record shall be deemed as final.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p class="org">IN-PLAY / IN-RUNNING RULES</p>
  <p>In-Play is where it is possible to bet during an ongoing game or event.   Bets will be accepted once the game or event begins and will cease once   the game or event is taken off the odds display. A variety of different   markets can appear during the duration of a game.<br></p>
  <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
    <li>All bets placed       In-Play are subject to a system acceptance procedure. This may result in a       delayed confirmation (or rejection) of each bet.</li>
    <li>The word "Pending" will be  shown on the bet receipt of any bet being processed by the system. This means that the bet has not been  confirmed or rejected yet.</li>
    <li>Pending bets will       be rejected should a significant event occur during the time of bet       placement. These events may include, but are not limited to, a goal, red       card, penalty or technical malfunction.</li>
	<li>Video Assistant Referee (VAR) decisions made after a significant event occurs, may result in confirmed bets being voided. Bets voided will be from the time of the significant event, until the time the final VAR decision was officially announced.</li>
    <li>In the case of In-Play, the company will enforce the       following conditions in order to ensure that bets are placed at the       correct time, at the correct price and under the correct circumstances, as       determined by us: <br>
    </li>
       <ol start="1" type="a">
         <li>The time in which a goal        / point is scored is determined solely by the company. We will not        entertain any references as to the time that a goal / point is scored as        stated in official league / club websites, media websites or "live        score" websites. </li>
         <li>If there are reasonable        grounds to suspect that a bet (or bets) has been placed after an event        has taken place in the game / event, we reserve the right to cancel such        bet(s) without having to provide any reason or burden of proof. </li>
         <li>In the event that the company website cannot be  accessed to update the score, odds or handicap-goal line, the company reserves  the right to cancel all pending bets placed at the time of the incident. </li>
    </ol>
  </ul><br>
  <p class="org">ISSUES RELATING TO TIMES</p>
  <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
    <li>If an event starts before its scheduled time, only bets   placed before the event starts will be considered valid. All bets placed   after the start of the game will be considered invalid or void, except   for In-Play bets.</li>
    <li>For events where injury or stoppage time is played, this is deemed to be part of regular time.</li>
    <li>Overtime will only count where stated in the individual sport rules.</li>
  </ul><br>
  <p class="org">DEAD HEAT RULES</p>
  <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
    <li>For markets where there is a dead heat with two or more winning   selections in an event, the winnings will be reduced. This reduction is   calculated by dividing the total stake by the number of selections of   that dead heat. This reduced stake is then multiplied by the original   odds to calculate the winnings. This part of the stake is then returned   to the customer, together with any winnings. The other part of the stake   is lost.</li>
    <li>For example:<br>
      <p>Stage 1 – You bet $5 on a selection at 16.0 (Potential  winnings of $75)</p><p>Stage 2 – Your selection is in a dead-heat with another selection both finishing in 1st place</p>
      <p>Stage 3 – Half your stake ($2.50) is applied at the original odds (16.0). Therefore the ‘Win / Loss’ is ($5.00 x 16.0) / 2 – $5.00 = $35.00. The ‘Return’ is ($5.00 x 16.0) / 2 = $40.00 </p>
<p>(In the event of more than two selections finishing in a dead heat, the bets will be divided respectfully).</p>
      <p>Effectively in a two way dead-heat, half (50%) of the   stake is applied at full betting odds and the other half (50%) of the   stake is lost.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The Dead Heat Rules will not apply where, in our  sole discretion, we   consider an event winner can be determined on a points  scored basis   (for example from an event group stage).</li>
  </ul><br>
  <p class="org">CHANGE OF VENUE</p>
  <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
    <li>If a scheduled venue is changed, all bets will be considered void if the original away team is now the home team.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to void all bets if we think other   change of venues scenarios could affect the outcome of the event, e.g.   Tennis change of surface.</li>
    <li>In certain situations, we may not void the bets. This   can include tournaments where both selections were originally considered   to be playing at a neutral venue and the change of venue has no impact.</li>
    <li>The individual sport’s rules will override these rules.</li>
  </ul><br>
  <p class="org">ERRORS</p>
  <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
    <li>While the company makes every effort to ensure that errors are   not made, we reserve the right to void a bet if there is a clear error.   This includes, but is not limited to:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Incorrect prices, which are clearly different from those available in the general market.</li>
      <li>Incorrect handicaps, Over / Unders, Totals, Lines, Spreads, etc.</li>
      <li>Incorrect fixtures, dates and times.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>We will endeavour to contact the customer when we void   bets in this instance, if possible. The information will also be relayed   in our Announcements section.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p class="org">IRREGULAR BETS</p>
  <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
    <li>Any member who the company suspects of cheating or damaging our platform   will have their bets voided and their account suspended without warning   or notification. This includes the use of forbidden artificial   intelligence equipment.</li>
  </ul><br>
  <p class="org">MAXIMUM PAYOUTS</p>
  <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
    <li>The maximum amount that can be won by one customer in any one day of betting, regardless of the stake, is USD($)1.5m or its equivalent in an accepted currency. This includes single bets and   parlays. The list below is a breakdown of each sport’s maximum payout:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Football and Basketball - USD($)1.5m</li>
        <li>E-Football, E-Basketball, E-Sports, Tennis, American Football, Baseball, Ice-Hockey, Rugby Union, Rugby League, Volleyball - USD$300,000 </li>
        <li>All Other Sports – USD($)200,000</li>
        <li>Novelty Markets – USD($)25,000</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>For Parlays that involve events from different levels, the lowest limit will apply.</li>
  </ul><br>
  <p class="org">Accept Better Odds</p>
  <p>The term "Accept Better Odds" means all selections added to the betslip   can be processed automatically, so long as the odds on offer show a   higher return than originally indicated at time of selection.   If the adjusted odds within the betslip show a lower return value than   originally indicated, the bet will not be processed automatically.  This feature can be turned on/off by selecting or unselecting the   "Accept Better Odds" tick-box located within the betslip. </p>
  
  <p class="org">Enhanced Price Specials / Multiples (Price Boosts)</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
      <li>These markets are offered at the discretion of the company and may be withdrawn at any time.</li>
<li>These markets are subject to a limited stake amount. This may be adjusted at any time.</li>
<li>The rules governing all Enhanced Price Specials / Multiples (Price Boosts) are the same as those stated within the General Rules above and Sports Rules of each sport. <br>

  - Football Example - ‘Manchester United to Win and Over / Under 2.5’ will comply with ‘1 X 2 &amp; Goals Over / Under’ Football Rules.&nbsp;
</li>
<li>These markets are offered on the basis of regular time and do not include Extra Time or Penalty Shootout (unless otherwise stated)</li>
<li>For Enhanced Price Multiples (Price Boosts), if an event is suspended when the result is unconditionally determined, then the bet will be settled accordingly as ‘Win’ or ‘Lose’.
<br>
- Football Example: If you select Over 2.5 Goals and the score is 2-1 at the time of suspension, then the selection will be considered a ‘Win’.
</li>
<li>For Enhanced Price Multiples (Price Boosts), if an event is suspended when the result is undetermined, then the bet will be ‘Void’.
<br>
- Football Example: If you select Correct Score 2-2 (at Full-Time) and the score is 1-1 at the time of suspension, then the bet will be ‘Void’. 
</li>
<li>For Enhanced Price Multiples (Price Boosts), the odds will be readjusted should one or more selections be a push or ‘Void’.</li>
    </ul>
