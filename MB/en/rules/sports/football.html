        <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
            <li>Unless otherwise stated, all Football bets will be settled based on the scheduled "90 minutes" play.</li>
            <li>The term "90 minutes" play includes any stoppage or injury time. This does not include the extra-time, golden goals, penalty shoot-outs, or a match result which was altered by the official referee or the relevant governing authority after the match. </li>

            <li>The term "45 minutes" play includes any stoppage or injury time for the first half of play. This does not include the extra-time, golden goals, penalty shoot-outs, or a match result which was altered by the official referee or the relevant governing authority after the match. </li>
            <li>For certain competitions or friendly matches where the scheduled play is 80 Minutes (2 x 40 minute halves), bets will be settled based on the scheduled time.</li>
            <li>Should there be any youth or friendly matches where play is set for 70 minutes (2 x 35 minute halves) or less, the company will announce before the start of the match. Otherwise all bets on these matches will be considered void.</li>

                <li>A "Handicap" means that a team receives a virtual head start, effectively leading the match by differing goals before it actually begins.</li>
                <li>All bets will be settled by factoring in the indicated handicap applied at the end of the bet type period.</li>
                <li>The favorite team, giving the handicap start, will be allocated the minus handicap and will be highlighted.</li>
                <li>A handicap can be a full goal start (e.g. -1, -2, -3, etc.), a half goal start (e.g. -0.5, -1.5, -2.5, etc.) or a split goal start (e.g. -0/0.5, -0.5/1, -1/1.5, etc.).</li>
