						<li>When betting on the Run Line and Total Runs (over/under) the game must conduct 7 innings (or 6.5 innings, when the 2nd batting team is already ahead) to have a result. If a game is called or suspended in an extra innings, the score will be determined after the last full inning unless the home team scores to tie, or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning, in which case the score is determined at the time the game is called.  </li>
            <li>The result is based on the official outright result of the match, including extra innings (when applicable).  </li>
            <li>If the scheduled venue is changed, all bets will be considered void.  </li>
            <li>If the game starts before the scheduled time, only bets placed before the game commenced will be considered valid. Bets placed after the game commenced will be considered void. This excludes In-Play bet types.  </li>
