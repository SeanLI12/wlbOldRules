          <div class="help-info">
            <p>Asian Handicap is a style of betting where the bookmaker handicaps the two teams in a game before its commencement. Using football as an example, the bookmaker gives a goals deficit to the team he thinks is more likely to win, and a head start to the team he thinks is less likely to win. The handicaps are expressed in goals, or fractions of goals. To win a bet, the end user, rather than backing a team to win, bets on it to overcome the handicap.</p>
