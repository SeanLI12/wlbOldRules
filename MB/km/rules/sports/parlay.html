   <p class="org">GENERAL</p>
   
   <p>
   A parlay bet is defined as individual bets which link two or more selections in a single bet. Each selection chosen in the parlay must win for the parlay ticket to be successful. If the first selection is a winning bet, the winnings and the stake are carried over on to the second selection. This continues until all selections are winning bets or one selection is a losing bet. Some parlays are a combination of different parlays in a single parlay ticket, e.g.  A Yankee is a combination of 11 different parlay bets. Please see the “Types of Parlay Bets” section for more information. 
   </p>
   <p>Example:</p>
   <p>A parlay treble of $100 is placed on the following three selections:</p>
   
   
       <ul>
        	<li>Manchester United @ 1.80</li>
		<li>Chelsea @ 1.50</li>
		<li>Arsenal @ 1.66</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<p>If all three selections win, the return on the parlay is $448.20. This is broken down as follows:</p>
   
   
       <ul>
        	<li>Bet 1: Manchester United 1.80 x $100 = Return of $180.</li>
		<li>Bet 2: Chelsea 1.50 x $180 = Return of $270.</li>
		<li>Bet 3: Arsenal 1.66 x $270 = Return of $448.20.</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<p class="b">Parlay Points:</p>
   
   
       <ul>
        	<li>188BET allows a maximum of ten selections to be combined in a parlay bet. </li>
		<li>All selections are subject to the relevant sports rules.</li>
		<li>Not all markets will be available for parlay betting. If you see in the bet slip that you cannot combine two unrelated selections (see below for details on related parlays), then one of the selections is not available for parlay betting. </li>
		<li>Parlay bets can be placed across sports and across days.</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<p class="b">RELATED SELECTION IN A PARLAYS</p>
	
	<p>Parlay bets, which combine selections that are related in the same event or where the outcome of one market could affect the outcome of another market, are not accepted. For example:</p>
	
	<p>Example:</p>
	<p>The following double is not accepted as it is seen as a related parlay:</p>
   
   
       <ul>
        	<li>Manchester United to win in the 1x2 market @ odds of 1.80</li>
		<li>Manchester United to win 2-0 in the correct score market @ odds of 7.0</li>
	</ul> 
	
	<p>If Manchester United win 2-0, the combined odds would be 12.6. However, the odds should only be 7.0 because if Manchester United win 2-0, they will automatically have won in the 1x2 market.</p>
	<p>Parlay bets that combine selections relating to the same team or player, even though they are settled at different times, are also not accepted as the outcome of one could affect the outcome of the other:</p>
  	<p>Example:</p>
   
       <ul>
        	<li>Manchester Untied to reach the Champions League Final @6.0</li>
		<li>Manchester United to win the Champions League @ 10.0</li>
		<li>Combined odds of 60.0</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This parlay is considered related as the result of the second selection impacts the first selection. If Manchester Untied win the Champions League, they will automatically have reached the final. Therefore, the odds can only be 10.0. </p>
	<p>188Bet reserves the right to void part or all of parlay bet if it is seen to be a related parlay.</p>

	<p><em>Please note: </em></p>
	<p>In the event that any part of the parlay bet is voided or is a push (as in the example below), the parlay bet will still stand and any winning selections will be carried forward to the remaining selections, as in the case of the following Treble:</p>
	<ul>
        	<li>Bet 1: Chelsea (-0.5) – Chelsea win.</li>
		<li>Bet 2: Manchester United (-1) – Manchester United win 1-0.</li>
		<li>Bet 3: Arsenal (-0.5) – Arsenal win.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As Manchester United only win 1-0 with a (-1) Asian Handicap, that bet is a push. Therefore, the “Chelsea win” bet is carried forward to the “Arsenal win” bet and the parlay bet becomes a winning Double on Chelsea and Arsenal instead of the initial parlay bet of a Treble.</p>
